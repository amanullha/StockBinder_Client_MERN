Hub really runs a similar mediator as Google Chrome (V8), yet gives an alternate arrangement of libraries and an alternate run-time climate. It likewise incorporates a bundle the executives framework (NPM) and a couple of language augmentations you won't track down norm in programs (for instance modules).So tl; dr - the JS mediator in Google Chrome and the JS translator in Nodejs are basically something similar.The thing that matters is, in a program your ultimate objective is to change stuff in a website page (text, designs, templates, and so forth), in Nodejs it's to run broadly useful code that could do anything from running a web server to controlling documents."
